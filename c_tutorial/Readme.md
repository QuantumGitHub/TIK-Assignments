# C crash course

Dear students,

We created a quick C crash course for you, as the coming assignments are written in C.
This crash course is not graded.
It is just a playground for you to familiarize yourself with C, and with some structures used in the Buddy assignment.

* In `tuto1.c`, you will learn about pointers, malloc and free.
* In `tuto2.c`, you will learn about the C preprocessor (including the `#define` constructs).
* In `tuto3.c`, you will learn about custom data types, strings, structures and about the `->` operator.
* In `tuto_buddy.c`, you will get some insights into the structures used by the Buddy assignment.
* Finally `playground.c` is a file for you to run your own C experiments.

Please play with the tutorials and familiarize yourself with the concepts.

To run them, make sure that you are in your Docker or Nix environment and that you are located in this directory. Then type:

`make tuto1`
or
`make tuto2`
or
`make tuto3`
or
`make tuto_buddy`
or
`make playground`
